\section{Executive summary}
\label{sec:executive-summary}

This report is produced for the \textbf{Tribunal of Bengodi}.

While performing the assessment we found out several network configuration errors and some software vulnerabilities that could allow a malicious entity to access, modify and even destroy some of the core processes of the Tribunal. Nonetheless some of the problems we found could lead to restricted form of identity theft: a malicious entity could find the VPN access credentials of some of the users and operate unauthorized / illegal actions as if it is the user having legitimate access to the system.

More precisely the network configuration issues and the software vulnerabilities, some with a Base CVSS score of 10, could lead to, in the worst case scenario, millions of euros to be payed as fees and / or damage compensation.

The countermeasures we proposed at network level are based on basic security and networking practices we mainly learned during other courses in the University; we also proposed other countermeasures that are not related to the context of IT security that are, in our opinion, necessary.

For each of the countermeasures we proposed we also gave a cost estimate, which is based on the market offerings found over the Internet and also a new quantitative assessment to make sure that the cost were justified by its benefit.

The observation time was fixed at one year which looked reasonable as this proposal aimed to allow clerks to get their job done from home due to COVID-19; taking into account the vaccination campaign in Italy we don't expect the critical situation to last more than this time interval.
